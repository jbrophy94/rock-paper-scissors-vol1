# rock-paper-scissors-vol1

Rock Paper Scissors game with a basic UI.

This has been completely reworked from the console version to
operate with a simple UI which contains 4 buttons. Three of the buttons
are for choices(rps) and one is to start a new series after either the player or computer has won 3 games (the button says New Game).
