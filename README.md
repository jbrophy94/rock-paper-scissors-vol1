Console rock paper scissors game

This is a simple game to be played in the console. The game takes user input
for a typical rock paper scissors game and compares the user's choice to a random selection made by the computer, and then determines the appropriate winner.
This is set up as a best of 5 series (first to 3 wins). At the end of each series,
the program will prompt the user on whether they would like to play again or not. There is no GUI at all for this version of the game. The entire game is played using prompts, alerts, and the console (the console is where you will see the majority of output, including the results of games and series).
